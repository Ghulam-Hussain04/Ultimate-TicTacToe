# ðŸ§  Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

An advanced implementation of **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** in Python, powered by the **Minimax algorithm** for AI decision-making. This project is designed for two players:  human vs. AI.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Ultimate Tic Tac Toe?

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a strategic twist on the classic game. The board consists of 9 small tic-tac-toe grids arranged in a 3x3 larger grid. Players must win small boards to claim positions on the big board â€” making each move count on multiple levels!
